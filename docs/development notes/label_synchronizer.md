## 27.3 In sync
Synchronization seems to work, might benefit from optimization, but whatever
Verification of synchronization created, synchronization seems to be working properly
Going to work with the first dataset
Created the Goals document, could be improved, but to me it's clear that the next step should be
to recreate the evaluations, in general.



Everything will be so much simpler, if it has a clear structure. I propose a pandas dataframe that has soruce, gt, tm, competitor, 01/02
adding it to the preprocessing

# 31.3 Out of space

My Mac ran out of space for the synchronized images, turns out, the files are saved uncompressed, while the originals are compressed.
Generated a code to replace the original synchronized images with their compressed versions.

Going to try and modify the label synchronized algorithm.



 248   0.123664

but SEG_log has GT_label=31 J=0.0

for 02 campaign, image 02_1585.tif
BF-C2DL-HSC 
DREX US


Why is that?

I see overlap in them, seems to me my calculation is correct
