Several notebooks were created in the past, loking back it was not a wise decision as
I don't know what they do, if they are deprecated or not.
Here I will go through them, try and extract useful information to be reused and revisited.


### Artificial_dataset
This notebook seems to have been used to create an artificial dataset,
with visualizations.

### cherry_picking
This notebook contains parsed table with cherry picked evaluations for better combinations of input competitors.
Sorted the results and evaluated how many were actually better.
Mostly useful for disseration table.

### Exploring data
Looks at Ground Truth and evaluates the number and size of segmentations.
Useful later, when deciding on QA bounding box sizes.

### Fusion algorithm
