# Project Proposal: A Robust Pipeline for Segmentation Ensemble Fusion

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a complete, three-stage pipeline for fusing multiple segmentation masks into a single, high-quality "silver-truth" annotation. The core challenge is to create a system that can intelligently combine a variable number of input segmentations, leveraging their collective wisdom while correcting for individual errors. This is further complicated by the sparse nature of ground truth annotations available for training, as seen in datasets like the Cell Tracking Challenge.

Our proposed solution consists of three main stages:

1.  **Quality Assurance (QA) Layer:** An initial filtering step to identify and exclude low-quality segmentations *before* fusion, using a dedicated QA model.
2.  **Fusion Input Generation:** A novel pre-processing step that transforms a variable number of input masks into a fixed-size, information-rich "Agreement Map". This elegantly solves the challenges of variable inputs and order invariance.
3.  **Fusion Model & Training:** A standard U-Net architecture that learns to refine the Agreement Map into a final segmentation, using the original source image as context. It will be trained using a specialized **Masked Loss Function** to handle the sparse ground truth annotations correctly.

This document provides a detailed breakdown of each stage and concludes with a clear, phased implementation plan to guide development.

## 1. Stage 1: Quality Assurance (QA) Layer

### 1.1 Objective

The primary goal of the QA layer is to improve the quality of the inputs to the fusion process. By preemptively identifying and filtering out segmentations of demonstrably poor quality, we reduce noise and prevent systemic errors from poisoning the final fused output. This step acts as a "gatekeeper" for the ensemble.

### 1.2 QA Model Design

We will train a dedicated deep learning model to predict the quality of a given segmentation mask.

*   **Inputs:** The model will take a two-part input:
    1.  The raw source image (e.g., `H x W x 1` for grayscale).
    2.  The segmentation mask from an ensemble member (e.g., `H x W x 1`).
    These will be concatenated into a multi-channel tensor (e.g., `H x W x 2`).

*   **Model Architecture:** A lightweight CNN classifier/regressor (e.g., a simplified ResNet or EfficientNet) will be used.

*   **Output Strategy (Recommendation: Regression):**
    1.  **Classification (Good/Bad):** A simpler approach, but less flexible. It requires a predefined, arbitrary threshold to generate labels for training.
    2.  **Regression (Predict Quality Score):** **This is the recommended approach.** The model will be trained to predict a continuous quality metric, such as the **Jaccard Index (IoU)** or Dice Score, against the ground truth. This provides a much richer, more nuanced output that allows for flexible thresholding during inference.

*   **Granularity of Assessment:**
    *   **Image-Level:** The model produces a single quality score for the entire segmentation mask of an image. This is simpler to implement and train.
    *   **Cell-Level:** A more advanced model (e.g., using Mask R-CNN-style architecture) would assess the quality of individual cell instances within an image. This offers more precise filtering but is significantly more complex.

### 1.3 Experimental Framework: Exclusion Strategies

The output of the QA model will be used to filter the ensemble. We will experiment with three strategies, ordered by increasing granularity and complexity:

1.  **Source-Level Exclusion:**
    *   **Method:** We assess a source model's performance across an entire validation dataset. If its average QA score falls below a set threshold, we disqualify that source model entirely from the fusion process for all images.
    *   **Pros:** Simple to implement; removes chronically poor performers.
    *   **Cons:** Very coarse; a generally good model might be excluded due to poor performance on a few outlier images.

2.  **Image-Level Exclusion:**
    *   **Method:** The QA model is applied to each segmentation mask for each image. If a specific mask for a given image receives a score below the threshold, only that `(source, image)` pair is excluded from the fusion.
    *   **Pros:** A good balance of precision and simplicity. Allows a source model to contribute where it performs well and be excluded where it fails.
    *   **Cons:** Does not correct for errors on a sub-image level.

3.  **Cell-Level Exclusion:**
    *   **Method:** Requires a cell-level QA model. The model identifies individual "bad" cell predictions within a single mask. These faulty cell instances are removed, while the "good" cell predictions from the same mask are kept.
    *   **Pros:** The most precise and powerful method, offering the highest potential for quality improvement.
    *   **Cons:** Highest implementation complexity for both the QA model and the filtering logic.

### 1.4 Limitations and Future Work

*   **Error Typing:** The initial regression model won't distinguish between error types (e.g., false positives vs. false negatives). Future work could involve a multi-headed model that predicts separate scores for precision and recall.
*   **Temporal Consistency:** For video data, this static model ignores temporal context. A future version could use a 3D-CNN or ConvLSTM architecture to analyze short image sequences, flagging segmentations that are inconsistent over time as likely errors.

## 2. Stage 2: Fusion Input Generation via Agreement Map

This stage is the core of our solution to the variable-input problem. After the QA layer filters the set of input masks, we generate a fixed-size input for our main fusion model.

### 2.1 Methodology

Given a set of `N` quality-approved binary segmentation masks `{M_1, M_2, ..., M_N}` for a single image:

1.  **Summation:** All masks are summed pixel-wise:
    `A_raw = Σ M_i`
    Each pixel in `A_raw` now holds an integer from `0` to `N`, representing the number of models that agree on that pixel being part of the foreground.

2.  **Normalization (Crucial):** The raw agreement map is normalized by `N` to make the process independent of the number of inputs:
    `A_norm = A_raw / N`
    Each pixel in this final **Agreement Map** now holds a float value from `0.0` to `1.0`, representing the *proportion* of models that agree. This map serves as a rich "confidence landscape".

### 2.2 Final Model Input

The fusion model will receive a multi-channel tensor constructed from:
*   **Channels 1-3:** The original RGB source image (or Channel 1 for grayscale).
*   **Channel 4:** The normalized Agreement Map (`A_norm`).

This fixed-size input `(H, W, 4)` is perfect for any standard segmentation architecture.

### 2.3 Key Advantages of this Approach

*   **Solves Variable Input Problem:** Any number of masks `N` is processed into a single-channel map.
*   **Inherent Permutation Invariance:** The summation operation is commutative (`A+B = B+A`), so the order of input masks does not matter.
*   **Provides Rich Context:** The fusion model can now see both the raw image features (edges, textures) and the areas of consensus and disagreement among the ensemble members.

## 3. Stage 3: The Fusion Model & Training Strategy

### 3.1 Fusion Model Architecture

*   **Model:** We will use a standard, well-established segmentation architecture like **U-Net**.
*   **Objective:** The U-Net will be trained to take the 4-channel input (Image + Agreement Map) and produce a final, refined, binary segmentation mask. It will learn to act as an "expert referee," using the source image to resolve disagreements visible in the Agreement Map and clean up noisy predictions.

### 3.2 Training on Sparse Ground Truth

The primary challenge in training is the sparse nature of the CTC ground truth. A naive loss function would incorrectly penalize the model for correctly identifying cells that were simply not annotated. We will address this with a specialized loss function.

*   **Priority 1: Masked Loss Function (Recommended Start)**
    *   **Concept:** The loss is calculated *only* on the pixels for which we have ground truth annotations. All other pixels are ignored.
    *   **Implementation:**
        1.  Create a binary `loss_mask` from the ground truth image, where `1` indicates an annotated pixel and `0` indicates an unannotated or background pixel.
        2.  Calculate a pixel-wise loss (e.g., Binary Cross-Entropy) between the model's prediction `P` and the ground truth `GT`.
        3.  Multiply this pixel-wise loss by the `loss_mask`.
        4.  The final loss is the sum (or mean) of this masked result, normalized only by the number of annotated pixels.
    *   **Benefit:** This correctly focuses the model's learning on the known data without punishing it for valid discoveries in unannotated regions.

*   **Priority 2: Hybrid Loss Function (Advanced Refinement)**
    *   **Concept:** A weighted combination of two loss terms to provide a learning signal across the entire image.
    *   **`Loss_GT`:** The primary **masked loss** described above, ensuring accuracy on GT annotations.
    *   **`Loss_Consistency`:** A secondary loss (e.g., Mean Squared Error or a smooth L1 loss) calculated over the *entire* image, which encourages the model's output `P` to be similar to the input `Agreement Map`. This acts as a regularizer, pushing the model to respect the ensemble consensus in unannotated areas.
    *   **Total Loss:** `L = α * Loss_GT + (1 - α) * Loss_Consistency` (where `α` is a hyperparameter, e.g., 0.8).
    *   **Benefit:** Can lead to cleaner, less noisy predictions in unannotated regions.

## 4. Project Plan & Priorities

This project will be executed in three distinct phases to ensure a stable, iterative development process.

### **Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP) - Core Fusion Pipeline**

*   **Objective:** Build and validate the core fusion mechanism.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Implement the Fusion Input Generation:** Create the logic to produce the "Agreement Map" from a set of input masks.
    2.  **Implement the Fusion Model:** Build a standard U-Net that accepts the multi-channel (Image + Map) input.
    3.  **Implement the Masked Loss Function:** This is critical for correct training.
    4.  **Train and Evaluate:** Train the model on the CTC dataset and establish a baseline performance metric.
*   **Exclusions for this phase:** The QA layer will be omitted. All available segmentations will be used as input.

### **Phase 2: Integration of the QA Layer**

*   **Objective:** Improve the fusion baseline by adding an intelligent input filter.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Train the QA Model:** Implement and train the regression-based QA model to predict IoU scores. Start with the simpler **Image-Level** granularity.
    2.  **Integrate QA into the Pipeline:** Use the trained QA model to filter the inputs before the Agreement Map is generated. Start with the **Image-Level Exclusion** strategy.
    3.  **Evaluate Performance Lift:** Quantify the improvement in the final fused output compared to the Phase 1 baseline.

### **Phase 3: Advanced Refinements and Experimentation**

*   **Objective:** Push the performance ceiling by exploring more complex techniques.
*   **Steps (to be explored based on previous results):**
    1.  **Granular QA:** Experiment with the **Cell-Level Exclusion** strategy if the QA model can be adapted for it.
    2.  **Advanced Loss:** Implement and test the **Hybrid Loss Function** to see if it reduces noise and improves overall segmentation quality.
    3.  **Future Work:** Begin prototyping ideas from the QA limitations, such as temporal analysis for video sequences.
