# General goal of the project

Generating a new silver truth is part of a bigger project of MLEM-QA - Machine Learning using Ensemble Methods and Quality Assurance. 
The project aims to improve the quality of the silver truth.
To achieve this goal, we want to explore two main directions:
1. QA part - Improving the selection criteria for the silver truth.
2. EM part - Improving the algorithm for generating the silver truth.

## The Setup

To be able to evaluate the effect of our modifications, we need to have a baseline.
The metric to improve is silver truth quality, which is evaluated ????
We were provided with a competition that contains 16 datasets.


recreated silver truth needs to match the exisiting silver truth ????



synchronize labels >> validate synchronization >> recreate evaluation of competitors >> generate silver truth >> evaluate silver truth >> improve silver truth
