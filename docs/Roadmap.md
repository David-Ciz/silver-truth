## Phase 2: Comprehensive Evaluation and Validation

**Goal:** To rigorously assess the performance of the novel QA-enhanced fusion method against state-of-the-art individual models and static ensemble methods.

*   **[ ] TODO** Compare proposed method against CTC Baseline and best individual models using standard metrics (IoU, Dice Coefficient, F1 score)
*   **[ ] TODO** Conduct evaluation on a separate, unseen test set
*   **[ ] TODO** Perform ablation studies: Test each component (Frame-by-Frame QA, Temporal QA, Dynamic Ensemble) individually to quantify its specific impact on overall performance

## Phase 3: Application and Generalization

**Goal:** To leverage the improved silver truth for training new models and explore the applicability of the developed methodologies to other computer vision domains.
