*   **Ensemble Deep Learning Object Detection Fusion for Cell Tracking Mitosis and Lineage.pdf**
    *   **Relevance**: This paper presents an approach that utilizes an ensemble of deep learning models for robust object detection, coupled with a fusion strategy to enhance the precision and reliability of cell identification. This directly relates to the project's goal of using ensemble methods for a better silver truth.

*   **FAIA-325-FAIA200407.pdf**
    *   **Relevance**: This paper focuses on fault diagnosis using a combination of AI techniques (fuzzy logic, ANNs, expert systems). While not directly about cell tracking, its exploration of robust and adaptive diagnostic frameworks using hybrid AI approaches could be relevant to the "Quality Assurance" aspect of generating a better silver truth.

*   **QANet_Quality_Assurance_Network_for_Micr.pdf**
    *   **Relevance**: QANet introduces a deep learning framework to quantitatively estimate image segmentation quality without human inspection. This is highly relevant to the project's aim of using "advanced techniques of Quality Assurance" for the silver truth, as it addresses how to assess segmentation quality programmatically.

*   **Topology_Preserving_Segmentation_Fusion_For_Cells_With_Complex_Shapes.pdf**
    *   **Relevance**: This paper describes a topology-preserving fusion method for merging complex shapes, important for establishing reference data for benchmarking segmentation algorithms. This directly informs the "Ensemble methods" and "fusion" aspects of generating silver truth, especially for challenging cell morphologies.
